Switching to windows 10 for some reason left me without the ability to use SoundSwitch(to change audio between my headphones/speakers at a key press). With some digging I found this is one of the many things nircmd(http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html)  can do so I just bound it with AHK to change on a key press.
